  There were plenty of transportation options at the hotel including readily available Uber and Lyft drivers (logos)
  and a train/trolley (pic of it), which offered free fare to nearby events associated with the conference. The
  conference was conveniently located directly across the street so we walked between the two (hotel across street pic).
  There were also plenty of restaurant and entertainment options within a 10 minute walking distance.
