  It was a healthy conference. There were plenty of sweets, but also healthier food options including vegetarian/vegan
  foods juices, and smoothies (health food pics). They offered a yoga session each morning (yoga pic) with a
  professional instructor. With so many places in walking distance and shear size of the conference and hotels, you
  walk a lot...a whole lot (Fitbit pics).
