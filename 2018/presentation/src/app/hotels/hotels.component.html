  The hotels were really cool and accommodations were great (pics of inside hotel. The Grand had a really nice outdoor
  garden (garden pic) where folks could chill and get fresh air. There were bean bags, gamer chairs, and couches
  (chair/bag pics) in the conference area and always plenty of seating for meals and talks.
