  The food was really good. They provided breakfast and lunch each day and dinner during the Wednesday party.
  Some free adult beverages were provided at all three parties. There was a constant supply of snacks and drinks
  between meals. There were food options for folks with various dietary needs and everything was labeled
  appropriately (general meal pics).
