  Every day was filled with fun activities including a Ready Player One movie night on Tuesday (RP1 movie pic and theater crowd),
  D&D quests each day (quest pic), a conference-hosted party on Wednesday, two sponsor-hosted parties on Thursday
  (party pics), a D&D game on Thursday night (Raj D&D pics), and an escape bus (bus pic) and Battle Bot (bot pics)
  competition on Wednesday. In addition, there were old school console gaming stations setup everywhere
  (console playing pics).
